<div class='content_heading'>Corrugated Plastic + Creasing Wheel</div>
<p>After getting really excited about the <a href='http://www.orukayak.com/'>Oru Kayak</a>, a kayak inspired by Robert Lang's work, I decided to try creasing corrugated plastic.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results, as even cheap plastics are nice to work with.  This process is best suited for large objects like kayaks, as the minimum feature size is limited by the size of the corrugation.  Using a combination of pressure from a creasing wheel and folding force, you can create sharp creases at almost any angle relative to the corrugation.</p><br>

<div align="center"><table>
	<tr>
    	<td><img src="media/creasing/crease-1.jpg" height="300" /><br /></td>
    	<td><img src="media/creasing/crease-2.jpg" height="300" /><br /></td>
    </tr>
</table></div><br>

<p>I was especially interested in Oru after <a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.12/people/calisch/10/skin.html'>my own kayak experiments</a>, and I had intended to try to create a replica.  I made some progress towards this, making some paper models and experimenting with curved creases:</p><br>

<p>This process could be given a CNC flavor in one of two ways.  First, you could simply print out or laser-etch a crease pattern and follow along with the creasing wheel.  Second, you could mount a creasing wheel head to a gantry machine like the ShopBot, which has a 5'x10' bed.  I'm hoping to refine my folded boat models soon and try using this process to make a watercraft.</p>
