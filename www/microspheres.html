<div class='content_heading'>Acrylic Microspheres + Silicone</div>
<p>Talking to my labmate Kenny Cheung one day this week, he told me about a project he'd started using the active ingedient in <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=puffy+paint&hl=en&safe=off&tbo=u&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS503US504&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ei=Aq_GUKqRKOyN0QHu84DoCA&ved=0CD8QsAQ&biw=1132&bih=836'>puffy paint</a>, thermoplastic microspheres, to make material fold.  I had to try it as part of this final project, so he gave me a sample of <a href='http://www.akzonobel.com/expancel/knowledge_center/tutorials/one/index.aspx'>Expancel microspheres</a> to play with.</p><br>

<p>To give the microspheres a medium in which to expand, I mixed them with <a href='http://www.smooth-on.com/Urethane-Rubber-an/c6_1117_1144/index.html'>Smooth-On 121-30</a>. This is a castable urethane rubber that sets up flexible but strong.  The 121-30 mixes at 1:1 by weight or volume.  I added as much Expancel as I felt comfortable wetting out, roughly 1:8 to the full 121-30 mixture by weight.</p><br>

<p>As a test, I cast some simple strips on <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapton'>Kapton</a> film.  I'm using Kapton because of its wide temperature range, but because we are only heating the samples to 200 degrees Fahrenheit, we could likely use another material.  Ideally, the film would have been slightly thicker for stiffness, but this worked for my tests.</p><br>
<div align='center'><img src="media/micro/test.jpg" height="450" /></div><br>

<p>I used an oven with significant air movement to maintain consistent heating.  Here is some footage I shot of the moment when one sample expands:</p><br>

<p>Below are some pictures of the samples after baking.  The results were mixed, as it was difficult to maintain even temperature across the bead.  Some samples creased perfectly to 180 degrees, while others bent and twisted.  When the samples curled, the outside of the urethane reached activation temperature before the rest.  This difficulty, however, spawned an interesting application of this process: If we can control the spread of head to specific creases, we could program which creases fold first.  In particular, a fatter bead is slower to heat, and so we might be able to program folding order simply using bead width.</p><br>

<p>These experiments lead to my next attempt at this process.  While tesselated folding patterns are my favorite, they are difficult to fold with only two hands.  If all the creases could fold at the same time, perhaps we could create tesselated foldings instantly.  Toward this end, I created two masks from laser-cut plastic to apply the Expancel-doped rubber.  These masks are based on Ron Resch's tesselation, one is for the mountain folds, the other for the valleys.</p><br>

    	<td><img src="media/micro/resch-cut2.png" height="300" /><br /></td>
    </tr>
</table></div><br>

<p>I sandwiched a large piece of Kapton between the masks, applied mold release to the plastic, and slathered the 121-30 through the slits.  Because the urethane is so viscous and the slits so narrow, you can do both sides in one cure without worrying about it dripping out.</p><br>

<p>After curing, the surface residue can be rubbed off easily, leaving only the traces.</p><br>

<p>Unfortunately, here the experiment goes awry.  Despite the mold release agent, the urethane prefers to stick to the nooks and crannies of the masks, rather than the smooth Kapton.  I couldn't unmask the film without removing all the traces.  I hope to repeat this experiment soon with thicker Kapton and wider mask slits.</p><br>
