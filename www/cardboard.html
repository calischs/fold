<div class='content_heading'>Laser + Cardboard</div>
<p>Scoring cardboard on the laser cutter is a similar process to <a href='poly.html'>vinyl-cutting polypropelyne</a>.  We tune the laser to cut nearly (but not all the way) through the cardboard, leaving a single ply to act as a hinge.  The precise settings used to achieve this will vary based on the type of cardboard, the type of laser, the cleanliness of the lens, etc., but some quick testing should show you good settings to use.  The picture above shows a hypar from scored cardboard, testing the limits of non-rigid foldable crease patterns in materials more rigid than paper.</p><br>

<p>Like vinyl cutting, to score both sides, we must do one first, cut out our pattern, flip it, and cut the remaining creases.  Without the roll-feed of the vinyl cutter, however, this is much easier.  We can do all the cutting with the laser, and we don't need any tape because the stock simply sits on the honeycomb bed.</p><br>

<p>Besides the hypar, I made some Resch-inspired tiles this way.  This was an attempt to get around the difficulty of simulataneously folding tesselated crease patterns.  Intead, we can precrease and fold each tile individually, linking them with laser-cut, press-fit cardboard pieces.</p><br>

<p>Once linked, these tiles conform to many three-dimensional shapes.  This behavior is remeniscent of Resch's flowing sheets of tesselated folds.</p><br>
