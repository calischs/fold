<div class='content_heading'>Laser + Sewing</div>
<p>I love combining laser cutting fabric and sewing -- it's a fast way to make professional looking garments and bags.  After covering D-Forms in class, I knew I had to make a reconfigurable backpack from one.  How many times have you tried to put a long, skinny object into your bag, and it won't fit?  With the D-Form backpack, you can carry objects of all aspect ratio!</p><br>

<p>The basic idea was to create a zippable D-Form, such that you can start zipping the zippers together at any point.  This would give you a bag in the shape of any of the D-Forms arising from the original shape.</p><br>

<div align='center'><table><tr>

</tr></table></div>

<p>To realize this dream, I laser-cut two ellipses from Nylon and sewed a zipper onto the edges.  Since they don't sell circular zippers (at least that I'm aware), the beginnings and ends are a little bit funny, but with practice this backpack is quickly reconfigurable.</p><br>

<p>I haven't taken good photos wearing the backpack yet, but I will do so soon and post them here.</p><br>
